* This is finally good ,i have started learning deep learning ,so i was following some notebooks from kaggle ...where i started learning image augmentation and image transforms ....i have increased trained data ...
In this project i have learnt some practical things like label enoding to the data and mainly about resent101 architecture and learning rate scheduler and exponential and pleatue learning rate scheduler and image augmentaion changing the size of images and tilting them tp certain angle ![0a1b0b7df2918d543347050ad8b16051](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73489688/194698664-49c2d0b1-4a00-415e-aaed-ba7fda32bafb.jpg)
so finally i got an accuracy of 76.9 and 0.89 loss 
I have finally tested whole dataset with resnet 101 ,actually i have gone through the visual transformer...but thought of doing with resnet 101 ...
