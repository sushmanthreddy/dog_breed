dog_breed_predictor
* This finally feels good, I have finally built an dog breed model predicts about 120 dog breeds with an accuracy of 76.9 and loss of 0.89
* I have learned so many things in project like image resizing , fliping of image to different angles and making grey images..
* I have mainly learnt about image augmentation from one of the kaggle notebooks 
* Next part was so much intersting ,I dont knew anything about CNN code so i was going through some codes in kaggle and encoutered so many errors while 
  writing about CNN ...
* I have also learnt about image ploting and graphs using matplotlib..

* Next part i have learned about ViT(visual transformers) ,and have learned about so many thing in visual transformers,it is more efficent than cnn...
* At this point , i have learned about data loader and loading data and splitig about data etc...
* Then after so many hit and trial , I have decided to build my model on resnet 101 ...
* I have found code with resent 54 then have modified it with 101 and added learning rate scheduler (pleatue)..
* finally kept epochs as 50 and started training the model and it got an accuracy with 76.9 and 0.89
